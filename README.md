# Members-Only

In this project we built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

> This README documents the steps involved to implement a Member-Only project which is based on Authentication.
